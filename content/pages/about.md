I am Ivan Dardi, a software engineer living in São Paulo, Brazil.

## Background

I have two degrees in Computer Science from the Federal University of São Paulo
(UNIFESP), and I've been working as a software engineer ever since 2019. I
didn't have any internships during my college years, so my first job was as a
Salesforce Consultant. I worked as one for 3 months and then got yoinked into a
software engineering and DevOps position at a fintech company. That was started
my career in the finance industry.

I've gone through a lot of different kinds of companies over the course of my
first 4 years of experience, including digital banks, financial advice
platforms, and day trading platforms. However, all those jobs had me working as
a DevOps or a hybrid developer with Typescript.

I then decided to switch the focus of my career to the Rust programming
language. Now that I had some experience under my belt and there were more Rust
positions open, it was the perfect opportunity for me. I landed a job in a
mobility solutions company using Rust and Python, which finally marked the start
of my career in Rust.


## Projects

I currently run the [Rust Programming Language Discord Server on
Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community), which as of 2024-04-28 has
around 52k members. It was founded in 2017 by me during my college years as a
way to learn more about the language and meet new people interested in it. It
has since grown into a community of people who are passionate about Rust and
want to help others learn it.

To manage that server, my moderator team and I use a bot called [FerrisBot for
Discord](https://github.com/rust-community-discord/ferrisbot-for-discord). It's
a collaborative open source project between me and the members of the server,
and it  helps deal with inline crate searching, running Rust code on the fly,
and a few other fun features.

## Experiences

I have experience with a wide range of technologies, including:

1. Software development (Rust, Python)
2. Operating systems (Linux, Windows)
3. Shell languages (Bash, Powershell)
4. DevOps (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform)
5. CI Tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GoCD)
6. Databases (SQLite and Postgres my beloveds)
7. Version Control Systems (Git, GitHub, Bitbucket)
8. Frontend development (Javascript, HTML, CSS, Angular.js, Vue.js)
9. Miscellaneous skills (Photoshop, Blender, Unity, OpenCV)
10.
