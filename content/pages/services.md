I learned Rust 9 years ago, and my goal is to help others use it effectively for
their projects and goals. Iâ€™m excited to share my knowledge and offer services
that can improve your Rust development.

Here are the services I'm offering:

## Rust Classes/Tutoring

I offer Rust classes for people in all experience levels:

* New to programming
* Developers with no Rust experience
* Developers with some Rust experience
* Advanced Rust programmers

The sessions will go over all the topics covered by the official [Rust
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). They can also optionally be focused on
individual topics instead, such as: concurrency, CLI tool writing, web
frameworks, embedded, and other use cases for the Rust language.

The classes are either individual tutoring sessions or group classes, with
flexible duration, frequency and amount.

If you'd like to schedule Rust classes or tutoring sessions, or if you have any
questions, please [contact me](/about#contact).

## Talks and Presentations

I can give talks and presentations about:

- The basics of Rust
- Rust's ownership system
- Writing idiomatic Rust code
- My journey with Rust and the community Discord server I created
- Approaches on how to learn Rust in a way that works for you
- Specific crates, libraries or tools written in Rust

Their depth and length are customizable based on your needs.

If you'd like to invite me for a talk or presentation, or if you have any
questions, please [contact me](/about#contact).

## Workshops

Workshops are group sessions focused on building practical Rust projects.

I can host workshops about:

- The basics of Rust
- Writing an API with Rust and a popular web framework
- Writing a CLI tool with Rust
- Writing a GUI application with Rust
- Writing a game with Rust
- Writing a library or crate in Rust
- Writing and using an FFI library

Workshops can be customized in duration, frequency and amount.

If you're interested in having me host a one-time-only workshop, or a series of
workshops, please [contact me](/about#contact).

## Consulting

I offer consulting services for Rust projects, using my 9 years of Rust and
programming experience to help you achieve your goals.
